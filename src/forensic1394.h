/**

 *
 * \brief Main header file for libforensic1394.
 */

/**
 * \mainpage libforensic1394
 *
 * The latest version of libforensic1394 can be found at:
 *      https://freddie.witherden.org/tools/libforensic1394/
 *
 * This API gives you access to the FireWire bus of contemporary operating
 *  systems in order to facilitate digital forensics on an attached device.
 *  Unlike existing APIs Forensic1394 is:
 *   - Modern; unlike existing FireWire libraries Forensic1394 supports the
 *      new `Juju' stack introduced in Linux 2.6.22.
 *   - Portable; with platform drivers existing for both Linux (Juju stack
 *      only) and Mac OS X (via I/O Kit).
 *   - Minimal; only functions required for performing digital forensics are
 *      provided.
 *
 * By omitting features not required in forensic applications (such as
 *  isochronous transfers) the API is both simple to use and port. For example
 *  the memory of an attached device can be read using the following code:
 *
 * \code
 * forensic1394_bus *bus;
 * forensic1394_dev **dev;
 * char data[512];
 *
 * // Allocate a bus handle
 * bus = forensic1394_alloc();
 * assert(bus);
 *
 * // Enabls SBP-2; required for memory access to some systems
 * forensic1394_enable_sbp2(bus);
 *
 * // Give the bus time to reinitialise
 * sleep(2);
 *
 * // Get the devices attached to the systen
 * dev = forensic1394_get_devices(bus, NULL, NULL);
 * assert(dev);
 *
 * // Open the first device
 * forensic1394_open_device(dev[0]);
 *
 * // Read some memory from the device
 * forensic1394_read_device(dev[0], 50 * 1024 * 1024, 512, data);
 *
 * // Data now contains 512 bytes of memory starting at an offset of 50MiB
 *
 * // Close the device and destroy the bus
 * forensic1394_close_device(dev[0]);
 * forensic1394_destroy(bus);
 * \endcode
 *
 * \section sbp2 Enabling SBP-2
 * In order to gain direct memory access to certain systems, namely Windows and
 *  GNU/Linux, it is necessary to present the target system with an SBP-2 unit
 *  directory.  This can be done by calling ::forensic1394_enable_sbp2.  It is
 *  usual for devices on the bus to take a couple of seconds to react to this
 *  change.  Therefore, client applications should ideally wait for ~2 seconds
 *  before attempting to read or write to a device.  Although there are
 *  provisions in the SBP-2 specification to determine when a target system has
 *  enabled the DMA filter, client-side API limitations currently prevent
 *  libforensic1394 from leveraging this.
 *
 * \section reset Handling Bus Resets
 * Bus resets occur when devices are added/removed from the system or when the
 *  configuration ROM of a device is updated.  The following methods are
 *  affected by bus resets:
 *   - ::forensic1394_open_device
 *   - ::forensic1394_read_device
 *   - ::forensic1394_read_device_v
 *   - ::forensic1394_write_device
 *   - ::forensic1394_write_device_v
 *
 * After a bus reset calls to all of these methods will result in
 *  #FORENSIC1394_RESULT_BUS_RESET being returned.  Applications should
 *  handle this by saving the GUIDs of any devices being accessed and then call
 *  ::forensic1394_get_devices.  Calling this will void all device handles.
 *  The new list of devices can then be iterated through and their GUIDs
 *  compared against saved GUIDs.  The GUID of a device can be obtained by
 *  calling ::forensic1394_get_device_guid.
 *
 * \section thread Thread Safety
 * libforensic1394 is thread safe at the device level with the restriction
 *  that devices can only be accessed by the thread that opened them.  This is
 *  because some backends, namely Mac OS X/IOKit, install thread-specific
 *  callback dispatchers upon opening a device.  When using multiple threads of
 *  execution care must be taken when calling ::forensic1394_get_devices (which
 *  closes and destroys any open device handles).  It is the responsibility of
 *  the caller to ensure that this is safe.  The process can be simplified
 *  through the use of an \a ondestroy callback handler.
